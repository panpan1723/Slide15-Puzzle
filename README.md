Slide15 is a React Application that implements a sliding puzzle game. The game board consists of 15 numbered square tiles and one empty space. The objective is to arrange the tiles in order by making sliding moves using the empty space. The Board component receives an initial configuration array and a callback function for when the puzzle is correctly sorted for the first time. The initial configuration array represents the initial arrangement of the tiles, with numbers indicating their positions and 0 representing the empty space. By using Slide15 Puzzle, players can enjoy the challenge of solving the 15-puzzle by strategically sliding the tiles.
